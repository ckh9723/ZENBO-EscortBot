# ZENBO-EscortBot
A mobile application for the ASUS Zenbo robot for event handling and user interface as an interactive exhibition robot guide. 
The robot can interact with users by either speech or UI. This app cannot be tested on Android Studio's virtual device and will 
work only when deployed on the ASUS Zenbo robot.  
  
The main module for the project is 'escortbot' which contains the source file 'MainActivity.java' for both the event handling and UI.
